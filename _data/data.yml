career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford's Department of Computer Science
      and a Research Fellow at the Oxford Institute for New Economic Thinking, where I develop 
      methodology and tooling for agent-based simulation models. I recently completed a DPhil in 
      computational statistics and machine learning at the University of Oxfordâ€™s Mathematical 
      Institute and Institute for New Economic Thinking under the supervision of Prof. J. Doyne 
      Farmer. Previously, I worked as a Research Scientist at Improbable, before returning to academia.
