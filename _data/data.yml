career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford's Department of Computer Science
      and a Research Fellow at the Oxford Institute for New Economic Thinking. I draw on computational
      statistics and machine learning to develop
      tools that help decision-makers reason about and experiment with complex systems using (often agent-based) 
      simulation models.
      
      I recently completed a DPhil in 
      computational statistics and machine learning at the University of Oxfordâ€™s Mathematical 
      Institute and Institute for New Economic Thinking under the supervision of Prof. J. Doyne 
      Farmer. Previously, I held visiting positions at The Alan Turing Institute and the University of
      Bristol as an Alan Turing Enrichment Student, and
      worked as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Improbable before returning to academia.
